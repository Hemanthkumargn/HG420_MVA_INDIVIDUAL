# Load the lung cancer dataset
lung_cancer_data <- read_csv("C:/Users/user/Desktop/Spring2024/MVA/Project/Hemanth/LUNGCANCER3.csv")

# Display the structure of the dataset
str(lung_cancer_data)

#Anwer: Loading the lung cancer dataset into R and displays its structure. The output shows that the dataset contains 309 observations and 18 variables. Each variable is identified as double (numeric), including the binary categorical variables encoded as numeric types (0 or 1).

# Assume `LUNG_CANCER` is the response variable and all others are predictors.
# Develop the full model with all predictors
full_model <- lm(LUNG_CANCER ~ ., data = lung_cancer_data)

# Summary of the full model
summary(full_model)

#Answer: Builds a linear regression model predicting LUNG_CANCER based on all other variables in the dataset.The distribution of residuals gives insight into the error variance, showing how the predicted values differ from the actual values. Display estimates of the model parameters (coefficients), their standard errors, t-values, and corresponding p-values. Coefficients with low p-values are statistically significant predictors of lung cancer in this model. Stars and symbols next to coefficients signify their significance levels, helping to quickly identify the most influential predictors.Includes R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values, indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model. An F-statistic with a very low p-value (near zero) indicates that the model is statistically significant.

# Developing a reduced model (Example: removing one predictor, HEIGHT_INCH)
reduced_model <- lm(LUNG_CANCER ~ . - HEIGHT_INCH, data = lung_cancer_data)

# Summary of the reduced model
summary(reduced_model)

# Comparing full model and reduced model to see if there is a significant difference
anova(full_model, reduced_model)

#Answer: This section compares a reduced model (excluding HEIGHT_INCH) with the full model. The summary again shows similar statistics, and the ANOVA comparison tests whether removing HEIGHT_INCH significantly worsens the model. The p-value associated with this test (from the ANOVA output) suggests that HEIGHT_INCH is not a crucial predictor, as excluding it does not significantly change the model performance.


# Checking coefficients of the full model
coefficients(full_model)

# Displaying pair plots for variables in the dataset
ggpairs(data = lung_cancer_data, title = "Relationships Among Lung Cancer Data Features")

# Getting 95% confidence intervals for the model coefficients
confint(full_model, level = 0.95)

#Answer: Lists the coefficients of the full model and their 95% confidence intervals. Confidence intervals that do not cross zero suggest significant predictors. This information is crucial for interpreting the stability and reliability of each predictor within the model.

# Getting fitted values from the model
fitted(full_model)

# Getting residuals from the model
residuals(full_model)

#Answer: Displays the fitted (predicted) values and residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) for each observation. Analyzing these can help identify patterns or anomalies in model predictions.

# Conducting an ANOVA to check the significance of the model
anova(full_model)

# Getting the variance-covariance matrix of the model coefficients
vcov(full_model)

# Plotting diagnostic plots for the regression model
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(full_model)

#Answer:Produces diagnostic plots to check for assumptions such as linearity, homoscedasticity, independence, and normality of residuals. These plots are vital for verifying the validity of the model's assumptions.

# Calculating and printing the R-squared value to evaluate model accuracy
r_squared <- summary(full_model)$r.squared
print(paste("R-squared of the model is:", r_squared))

#Answer: Outputs the R-squared value, quantifying how well the model explains the variability in the response variable. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
