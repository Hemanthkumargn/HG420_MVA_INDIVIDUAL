#Ans: The code above generates subsets of the lung dataset according on the clusters allocated by the kmeans4.lung clustering algorithm. Here's a breakdown of every part.

#colnames(clus1) <- "Cluster 1": This line renames the column in clus1 to "Cluster 1". This is useful in determining which cluster the data in clus1 belongs to.

#Similarly, the next lines construct subsets clus2, clus3, and clus4 for clusters 2, 3, and 4, and rename their corresponding columns.
