#Answers:
#Summarize what each of these models is telling you about yourself and the class? 
#Ans: PCA simplified the complex social media data while retaining the significant differences. It identified significant patterns that reflect the largest changes in data. The main pattern explained 26.1% of these differences, while the next explained 19.1%, demonstrating that class members utilize social media in a variety of ways. This suggests that PCA identified significant trends in how the class uses various social media sites.

#Cluster Analysis was done on the PCA scores, resulting in the data being classified into four separate clusters. This investigation sought to categorize class members based on similarities in their social media usage patterns. The depiction of these clusters demonstrated how class members are segmented depending on their primary component scores, revealing varied groups within the class defined by their distinct social media behavior.

#Factor analysis was used to find underlying variables that explain the pattern of correlations identified in social media data. Three indicators were identified, indicating how different social media networks such as Instagram, LinkedIn, and Snapchat, load on these characteristics. This demonstrates various levels of social media activity among class participants, including professional networking, multimedia sharing, and messaging.

#Provide a takeaway from the analysis?
#The combined findings from PCA, Cluster Analysis, and Factor Analysis demonstrate the multidimensional character of social media involvement among class members. There are considerable differences in how people utilize different platforms, which can be classified into diverse patterns of behavior and linked to underlying variables. This study not only aids in understanding the common trends in social media usage, but also in identifying certain groups within the class for targeted studies or interventions based on social media activity.
