#* The standard deviation shows how much of the original data's variation is captured by each primary component. The first principal component (PC1) has the biggest standard deviation of 1.6925, indicating that it accounts for the most of the volatility in the original data. As we progress down the list of primary components, the standard deviation drops, indicating that each succeeding component accounts for less and less of the overall variation.

#* The proportion of variance reveals how much of the original data's variance is explained by each major component. For example, the first principal component (PC1) explains 16.85% of the total variance in the data, while the second component (PC2) accounts for an additional 11.52%. As we progress down the list of principle components, the proportion of variation explained by each component decreases.

#* The cumulative proportion represents the total amount of variance in the data explained by each principal component and all previous components. For example, the first principal component (PC1) accounts for 16.85% of the data's variation, whereas PC1 and PC2 combine to account for 28.37%. The cumulative proportion can help determine how many primary components to keep for future investigation.

#The first three PCs (PC1, PC2, and PC3) together account for 38.5% of the variance in the data. The first seven PCs (PCs 1â€“7) explain 66.5% of the variance, whereas the first 14 PCs explain 94.1% of the variance. As a result, the top few PCs appear to capture the majority of the data's volatility. The report also shows that the standard deviation of each PC lowers as the PC index grows. This means that the amount of variation explained by each PC diminishes as the index rises. The proportion of variance and cumulative proportion for each PC follow a similar trend.
